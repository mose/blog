There is no secret, I'm not a huge blogger. I had a [blog on tumblr][tumblr-mose] because I wanted to see how they made it, but this was not really fed with so much attention.


So, now I'm trying to get more serious in publishing textual content rather than code. And this is best done in markdown on [github-pages][gh-pages] setup with [jekyll][jekyll]. Last versions of that preprocessor really made it solid and easier to use.
